# WTF Opera Mini?!


![Stat Counter Browser Statistics for Nigeria](images/Nigeria.png)

According to [StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-NG-monthly-201412-201511), **73% of users in Nigeria** use Opera Mini as their browser on mobile. This is a stark difference to the **global percentage of 11%**.

This is a huge problem because Opera Mini today is basically like IE 8. It has terrible support for a lot of development features we take for granted.

[WTF Opera Mini?!](http://wtfoperamini.com) is a list of all the unsupported or partially supported development features, and some crowsourced workarounds for them. 

Although this is directed at Opera Mini, this can be a useful resource for anyone practicing progressive enhancement or graceful degradation.

## Contribute

Help contribute to the workarounds!


**Step 1. Create a public [Code Pen](http://codepen.io/pen/) with your workaround**

[See example](http://codepen.io/ireade/pen/rxeXBR)


**Step 2. Fork this repository**


**Step 3. Find the file for the feature your workaround is for**

Workaround files are in `workarounds/` directory.
If the file for your workaround does not yet exist, create one. The title of the file should be the same as the path on the website. 

For example, for the [CSS3 2D Transforms](http://wtfoperamini.com/#/transforms2d) feature, the url on the website is `http://wtfoperamini.com/#/transforms2d`, and the corresponding file name is `transforms2d.json`.


**Step 4. Add your workaround details**

You will need two details -

- Your codepen username
- The id for your pen

You can get these details from the url to your pen. The url structure for a pen is `http://codepen.io/[codepen_username]/pen/[pen_id]`

For example, for the pen at `http://codepen.io/ireade/pen/rxeXBR`, the details added to the file in `workarounds/transforms2d.json` were -

```
{
	"1": {
		"codepen_username": "ireade",
		"pen_id": "rxeXBR"
	}
}
```

**Step 5. Add your name to the contributors list** (optional)

In the `README.md` file, add your name (and link if you wish) to the bottom of the list.



**Step 6. Submit a pull request for your addition**
